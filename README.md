# Zooo
so in the zoo we have an Animal.I choosed to work on two types of animals
Mamals and bird.Mamals has two types as in the polar bear and pig while bird has owl and the humming bird.
I assigned 7 diffren ttype of animals for each category.
I have three diffrent Interfaces.
I attches the diagram as a screen shot of pictures.
An interface in C# contains only the declaration of the methods, properties, and events, but not the implementation. It is left to the class that implements the interface by providing implementation for all the members of the interface.
